This project is an implementation of the classic Pacman game, enriched with additional features and enhancements. Developed as part of a university project, the game includes custom improvements such as extra lives, doubling the earned points, ghost slowdown or freeze, and increased Pacman speed to provide an enhanced gaming experience. The game stores and displays a leaderboard, keeping track of high scores achieved by players. All graphics (except for the menu logo and background of "New Board" frame) are my creations :)
